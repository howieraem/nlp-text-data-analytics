# Mental Health Data Analysis and Prediction

Predict whether an employee is likely to seek mental health treatment from survey responses.

## Environment Setup (Optional)

If you'd like to run the code yourself but don't have a conda/pip environment with scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn installed,
you can manually install them, or you can use `environment.yml` to create a new conda environment:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

To use this environment:

`conda activate mh_venv`

If you decide to use your own existing environment, please ensure your pandas and scikit-learn versions are not much newer than those in `environment.yml`,
otherwise some code blocks in the notebook may fail or yield unexpected outputs.
